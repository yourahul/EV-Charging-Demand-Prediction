#ðŸ”Œ EV Vehicle Charging Demand Prediction
This repository contains the end-to-end machine learning project developed as part of my internship at Shell India x AICET x EDUNET FOUNDATION. The objective is to forecast electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across counties in Washington State using historical registration data. The predictions aim to support EV infrastructure planning â€” especially for anticipating charging station demand.
